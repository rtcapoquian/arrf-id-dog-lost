4.3 Legal Form of Business (type of ownership)
ARRF ID will be established as a General Partnership, registered under Philippine law.
This legal structure has been chosen based on several key considerations:
1. Shared Resources and Expertise: The partnership structure allows the founders to
combine their technical expertise, business acumen, and financial resources to
Internal Use
establish and grow the business effectively. Each partner brings unique skills and
capabilities that complement the overall business objectives.
2. Financial Structure: Under the partnership agreement, the initial capital investment
will be shared equally among the partners, with profits and losses distributed
according to predetermined proportions as specified in the partnership agreement.

Table 5.1 Summary of Funding Sources Candidates with Funding Stage Alignments
ARRF-ID can strategically utilize a combination of funding sources that are suited
to its developmental phases. In the pre-seed stage, government grants from agencies like
the Department of Science and Technology (DOST-SETUP or DOST-PCIEERD) and the
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) provide non-dilutive funding to support
Internal Use
prototyping, technical validation, and early R&D. This is complemented by angel investors
from networks such as the Philippine Angels or Manila Angel Investors Network, who offer
early capital, mentorship, and industry connections. Crowdfunding platforms like The
Spark Project, Gava, GoFundMe, and Patreon can simultaneously validate market demand,
generate pre-sales revenue, and build a community of early adopters. As the product
progresses to the seed stage, incubators and accelerators like IdeaSpace, QBO Innovation
Hub, or LaunchGarage become critical, offering seed funding, mentorship, workspace, and
investor networking opportunities to refine the business model and prepare for scaling.
Moving into Series A and B funding rounds, venture capital firms such as Foxmont
Capital, Kickstart Ventures, or 500 Startups Philippines can inject growth capital to expand
manufacturing capabilities, enhance technology, and penetrate regional markets. Corporate
partnerships with pet industry leaders (e.g., MetroPets, Petronas) or tech companies (e.g.,
Globe, PLDT) can further accelerate growth through co-development funds, distribution
partnerships, or integrated tech solutions. By Series C or D, ARRF-ID may leverage bank
loans from institutions like BPI Family Bank or BDO to finance large-scale production,
supported by established revenue streams and collateral. Academic and research grants
from universities (e.g., UP, Ateneo) or DOST programs can supplement R&D costs at any
stage, fostering innovation through low-cost collaboration with academic experts.
In the pre-seed phase, ARRF-ID would prioritize non-dilutive grants, angel
investors, and crowdfunding to minimize equity loss while validating its concept. During
the seed stage, accelerators and angel syndicates would bridge the gap to prepare for
institutional investment. For Series A and B, growth-focused venture capital firms and
strategic corporate partners would drive scaling, market expansion, and technological
Internal Use
refinement. By Series C or D, it shifts to securing larger loans or private equity to meet
production demands and sustain growth. Finally, in the public market phase, ARRF-ID
could pursue an initial public offering (IPO) on the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) to
raise capital for global expansion while providing liquidity to early investors.
This funding staged-based approach ensures ARRF-ID secures the right
combination of capital, expertise, and partnerships at each milestone that balances equity
preservation with strategic growth to establish itself as a leader in pet tech innovation.
5.3 Project Cost
ARRF-ID’s project cost will revolve around a series of equal payments done over
a very long timeline known as ordinary perpetual annuity or perpetuity in short. In this
case, the capitalized project cost will be estimated based on the periodical operating
expenses and income taxes. This cost shall resemble the present worth of ARRF-ID over a
prolonged planning horizon. The Philippines’ annual inflation rate as of January 2025 is
2.9% based on data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). Hence, we assume the
capitalized project cost calculation to be per annum or per year on a periodical basis. The
formula for capitalized project cost is based on perpetuity and is showcased below:
𝑃 =
𝐴
𝑖
Internal Use
P represents the present worth or the capitalized cost of ARRF-ID, A defines a series
of periodic equal payments that is per annum or on a yearly basis, and i substitutes for the
current annual inflation rate in the Philippines, which is 2.9%.
